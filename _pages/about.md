Hello there! I'm Filip. From Software Engineering to Medicine to Data Science, I’m a digital-age Renaissance man who navigates life’s winding paths with curiosity as my compass.

My journey began in Croatia, where, at the age of 11, I dove headfirst into coding and algorithmic problem-solving, competing on national level throughout middle school and high school. These foundational experiences shaped my critical thinking skills, paving the way for venturing into Physics, where I eventually reached the international competition level.

Always seeking to broaden my horizons, I moved to the United States at the age of 18 to pursue a dual degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. My undergraduate studies intertwined with a series of experiences at Facebook: two times as a software engineering intern, where my performance led to a full-time offer upon graduation. For the first time in my career, I had the privilege to hone essential Data Science skills, such as writing SQL queries, performing A/B tests, and crafting monitoring dashboards on one of the world’s most expansive datasets.

Even though my time at Facebook was filled with invaluable experiences, after over half a decade in the US, I yearned to return to Europe and pursue my long-held curiosity in the field of Medicine. Thus, in 2020, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, I took the plunge and enrolled in the Medicine program at the University of Manchester. I thrived in this interdisciplinary field, unraveling the intricacies of the human body during the completion of my first year.

Yet, the confines of the pandemic revealed to me my most profound passion: at the core of my motivation lies the exhilaration of exploration, the joy of discovery, and the drive to unearth new insights. And coding, the "superpower" I honed since childhood empowers me to do what I love the most on a grand scale as a Data Scientist.

And so, I return to the 11-year-old kid who realized that moving mountains and uncovering new horizons lay at his fingertips. For me, coding isn't just about writing lines of code; it's a tool for problem-solving, pattern discovery, and deriving insights from data. My background might seem varied, but each experience has instilled a keen sense of curiosity and nurtured a unique interdisciplinary perspective.

I currently reside in France, in the picturesque city of Lyon, with my partner and our three beloved cats. When I'm not staring at screens, I love to roller-skate through Lyon, ski in the French Alps, work on my French, and annoy my cats as a trained classical singer and pianist.
